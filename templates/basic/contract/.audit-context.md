## Baseline Quality Metrics

### Compilation

- Errors:
  - error: 1. 🔨️  Use `cargo near build` instead of `cargo build` to compile your contract
  -        💡  Install cargo-near from https://github.com/near/cargo-near
  -        
  -        2. ✅ Use `cargo check --target wasm32-unknown-unknown` instead of `cargo check` to error-check your contract
  - error: could not compile `near-sdk` (lib) due to 1 previous error
  - 

### Clippy Analysis
- Errors: 0
- Warnings: 0



### Test Coverage

## Recommendations for Audit

- FIX COMPILATION ERRORS BEFORE AUDIT

## Agent Instructions

1. **Reference this context** before starting detailed analysis
2. **Don't report issues already flagged by clippy** (unless they're security-critical)
3. **Focus on logic bugs, security, and architecture** beyond what tooling catches
4. **Validate test coverage** for critical functions
5. **Check if clippy warnings indicate deeper issues**

This baseline helps avoid duplicate findings and focuses audit effort on high-value areas.
